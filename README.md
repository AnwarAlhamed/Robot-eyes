### In this task, I made a circuit containing two (leds), the power and operation circuit for (LEDs).
I connected the LEDs in parallel, two 220 ohm resistors were placed in the positive pole of the LEDs to reduce the current passing through them as the appropriate current is 20 milliamps, at the input of the circuit I placed a voltage regulator to convert the voltage from (9-volts) to 5 constant volts to feed the entire circuit Appropriately, I placed a transistor so that the LEDs could be controlled correctly, and the base of the transistor was connected to a microcontroller and in this case it was connected to the Arduino in order to be controlled and the power reduction circuit worked by turning off the LEDs many times per second (in this case 50 times/second)
### The circuit design 
The circuit contains:

-  Arduino UNO.
- 2 LEDs.
- Transistor.
- Voltage regulator
- Wires ( red= power , black= ground )
 
and the circuit was designed using tinkercad website as below:
